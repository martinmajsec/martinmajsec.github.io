About me
==========

I am a computer science student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). 
As part of [MODISTe](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/modiste), 
I recently completed my BSc thesis on an [open problem related to spanning trees](http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/op/minimal_graphs_with_a_prescribed_number_of_spanning_trees) 
under the supervision of prof. dr. sc. Anamari Nakić. 
I've most recently worked on Virtue, a programming language developed by Zorislav Shoyat that enables automatic parallel execution of programs.

I am interested in most areas of research in mathematics and computer science related to algorithms. 
Some particular interests include:  
- Computability and decidability
- Discrete mathematics: graph theory, combinatorial game theory
- Approximation algorithms
- Complexity theory: reductions

Lately, I have also been exploring topics like:
- Programming languages: functional programming, compiler design, domain-specific languages
- Domain-specific computer architecture

I am proud to teach competitive programming to elementary and high school students at Zagrebački Računalni Savez.
Over the course of three years, I have regularly mentored over 20 students, in groups of 4–8 students per year.
The lectures are primarily designed to prepare students for the state competitions Infokup and COCI, where participants face problems that range from ad hoc implementation challenges to clever use of well-known algorithms.

My favorite approach to mathematical problems is setting up inequalities.
When that doesn't work, I also like boxing and swimming.
