I am a 3rd year computer science student at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). 
As part of [MODISTe](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/modiste) (site in Croatian), 
I am currently working on an [open problem regarding spanning trees](http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/op/minimal_graphs_with_a_prescribed_number_of_spanning_trees) 
under the supervision of Prof. Anamari Nakić.

I am interested in most areas of research in mathematics and computer science related to algorithms. 
Some of my particular interests are  
- Complexity theory: hardness, reductions
- Combinatorics: discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorial game theory
- Algorithms and their analysis
- Approximation algorithms

Some other topics I am getting into include:
- Programming languages: functional programming, language translation, compiler design
- Functional equations

My favourite approach to mathematical problems is setting up inequalities.
