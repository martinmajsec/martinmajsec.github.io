About me
==========

I am a third year computer science student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en). 
As part of [MODISTe](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/modiste) (site in Croatian), 
I am currently working on an [open problem regarding spanning trees](http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/op/minimal_graphs_with_a_prescribed_number_of_spanning_trees) 
under the supervision of prof. dr. sc. Anamari Nakić.

I am interested in most areas of research in mathematics and computer science related to algorithms. 
Some particular interests include:  
- Complexity theory: hardness, reductions
- Combinatorics: discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorial game theory
- Algorithms and their analysis
- Approximation algorithms

Some other topics I am looking into include:
- Programming languages: functional programming, language translation, compiler design
- Functional equations

I am proud to teach elementary and high school students 
competitive programming at Zagrebački Računalni Savez.
Over the course of three years, I have regularly mentored a total of over 20 students,
guiding two groups of 4–8 students per year.
The lectures are primarily designed to prepare students for the state
competitions Infokup and COCI, where participants face problems that range from ad hoc implementation
challenges to clever use of well-known algorithms.

My favorite approach to mathematical problems is setting up inequalities.
When that doesn't work, I also like boxing and swimming.
