About me
==========

I am a computer science student at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en), currently on an exchange semester at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
] (https://www.epfl.ch/en/). 
As part of [MODISTe](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/modiste), 
I recently completed my [BSc thesis](https://repozitorij.fer.unizg.hr/islandora/object/fer:13985) on an open problem related to spanning trees
under the supervision of prof. dr. sc. Anamari Nakić. 
Outside of studies, I've most recently worked on Virtue, a programming language developed by Zorislav Shoyat that enables automatic parallel program execution.

I am interested in most areas of research in mathematics and computer science related to algorithms, especially approximation algorithms and discrete mathematics (graph theory, combinatorial game theory). I am drawn to theory of computation, which led me to come study it further at the EPFL.

Outside of classes, I like looking into programming language design. I'm really interested in how to leverage domain-specific settings to get better performance, so I'm exploring domain-specific computer architecture and languages, but also restricted theoretical models of e.g. computation, or memory management, which could provide a theoretical foundation for what can and can't be done. If you have something interesting to share, reach out!


I teach competitive programming to elementary and high school students at Zagrebački Računalni Savez.
Over the course of four years, I have regularly mentored over 20 students, in groups of 4–8 students per year.
The lectures are primarily designed to prepare students for the state competitions Infokup and [COCI](https://hsin.hr/coci/announcement.html), where participants face problems that range from ad hoc implementation challenges to clever use of well-known algorithms.

My favorite approach to mathematical problems is setting up inequalities.
When that doesn't work, I also like boxing and swimming.
